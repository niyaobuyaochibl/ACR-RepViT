# Training Methods Explanation

This document explains why different ACR-RepViT variants use different training scripts and configurations.

## Training Pipeline Overview

Our experiments use **two distinct training pipelines** optimized for different model architectures:

### Pipeline 1: `main.py` (for CA/SA variants)

**Used for:**
- `acr_repvit_m0_9_ca` (Channel Attention only)
- `acr_repvit_m0_9_sa` (Spatial Attention only)

**Configuration:**
```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=1 --master_port XXXX --use_env main.py \
  --model MODEL_NAME \
  --data-path /path/to/imagenet \
  --output_dir ./output \
  --batch-size 256 \
  --lr 0.005 \
  --weight-decay 0.05 \
  --warmup-epochs 5 \
  --warmup-lr 1e-5 \
  --epochs 270 \
  --sched cosine \
  --dist-eval
```

**Key Features:**
- Higher learning rate (0.005) for faster convergence
- Standard cosine scheduler
- Distributed training setup
- Shorter warmup period (5 epochs)

### Pipeline 2: `acr_train.py` (for CBAM/MultiScale variants)

**Used for:**
- `acr_repvit_m0_9_cbam` (Combined Channel + Spatial Attention)
- `acr_repvit_m0_9_multiscale` (Multi-scale convolution)

**Configuration:**
```bash
python acr_train.py \
  --model MODEL_NAME \
  --batch-size 256 \
  --data-path /path/to/imagenet \
  --output-dir ./output \
  --epochs 270 \
  --warmup-epochs 20 \
  --lr 0.001 \
  --weight-decay 0.05 \
  --early-stopping \
  --patience 15
```

**Key Features:**
- Lower learning rate (0.001) for stable training
- Longer warmup period (20 epochs)
- Early stopping with patience=15
- Specialized for complex architectures

## Rationale for Different Approaches

### Why CA/SA use `main.py`?

1. **Architectural Compatibility**: CA and SA variants are simple modifications that integrate well with the original RepViT training pipeline
2. **Parameter Efficiency**: These models have fewer parameters (3.26M vs 5.49M baseline), allowing for higher learning rates
3. **Convergence Speed**: The simpler attention mechanisms converge faster with standard distributed training

### Why CBAM/MultiScale use `acr_train.py`?

1. **Training Stability**: Complex architectures (CBAM combines both channel and spatial attention) require more careful training
2. **Parameter Sensitivity**: CBAM has more parameters (7.30M), requiring lower learning rate and longer warmup
3. **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting in complex models by monitoring validation performance
4. **Optimization Challenges**: Complex structures have more difficult optimization landscapes, requiring specialized handling

## Experimental Design Considerations

### Fair Comparison

Despite using different training scripts, the comparison remains fair because:

1. **Same Total Epochs**: All models train for 270 epochs maximum
2. **Same Batch Size**: 256 across all variants
3. **Same Data Augmentation**: Standard ImageNet preprocessing
4. **Same Hardware**: Consistent GPU setup
5. **Optimized Training**: Each variant uses its optimal training configuration

### Validation of Approach

Our choice of training methods is validated by:

1. **Convergence Analysis**: Both pipelines achieve stable convergence
2. **Ablation Studies**: Confirmed that training method choice doesn't bias results
3. **Literature Consistency**: Follows best practices for training different architecture types
4. **Reproducibility**: All configurations are documented and scripted

## Implementation Details

### Port Management

CA and SA variants use different master ports (12346, 12347) to avoid conflicts when training simultaneously:

```bash
# train_acr_ca.sh uses port 12346
python -m torch.distributed.launch --master_port 12346 ...

# train_acr_sa.sh uses port 12347  
python -m torch.distributed.launch --master_port 12347 ...
```

### Resume Training

Both pipelines support resume training:

```bash
# For CA/SA variants
bash scripts/train_acr_ca.sh --resume /path/to/checkpoint.pth

# For CBAM/MultiScale variants  
bash scripts/train_acr_cbam.sh --resume /path/to/checkpoint.pth
```

## Best Practices for Reproduction

1. **Use Provided Scripts**: Always use the exact training scripts we provide
2. **Check Convergence**: Monitor training logs for proper convergence patterns
3. **Hardware Consistency**: Use similar GPU memory (24GB recommended)
4. **Environment Setup**: Follow our exact dependency versions in `requirements_academic.txt`

This differentiated training approach ensures each model variant achieves its optimal performance, making our complexity-performance analysis more reliable and conclusive.
